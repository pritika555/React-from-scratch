# JOb of Parcel

-Transpiling of jsx code
-Parcel does this transpiling job with the help of external package itself which is Babel.

# Babel
-Babel is a JavaScript compiler commonly used in web development. It enables developers to write modern JavaScript code using the latest syntax and features and then converts (or "transpiles") that code into an older version of JavaScript for compatibility with older browsers or environments that do not support the latest standards.

# Key Features of Babel:
Transpilation: Converts ES6/ESNext code (modern JavaScript) into ES5 (older JavaScript) for broader browser compatibility.
Plugins and Presets:
Plugins: Customize Babel's behavior, such as transforming specific syntax.
Presets: Collections of plugins for common configurations, like @babel/preset-env.
Polyfilling: Babel can integrate with libraries like core-js to add missing features to environments by including "polyfills."
Customizable: Developers can configure Babel via a .babelrc file or babel.config.js file to suit their projectâ€™s needs.
